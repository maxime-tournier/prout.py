`prout.py` is a simple python package that does some of what
[QGLViewer](http://libqglviewer.com/) does, but in pure python.

The goal is to have something easy to hack from for trying stuff out.

## DONE

- projection matrix
- rotation trackball
- translation
- zoom

## TODO

- fix resizeGL
- animation
- inertia when rotating/translating fast
- axis/grid
- picking
- set pivot point
- PyQt/PySide 4/5 compatible
